# SPECFEM3D

## Mini app ID

SPECFEM3D is a software for the simulation of 3D seismic waves in any region of
the Earth, handling a variety of physical conditions and models. The associated
mini-app comes in three different flavors, respectively performing a simulation of
simplified models representing elastic isotropic, elastic anisotropic and viscoelastic isotropic materials.
