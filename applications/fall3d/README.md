## Simulation Cases 

- **Highly Relevant** [Eruption plumes extended more than 30 km in altitude in both phases of the Millennium eruption of Paektu (Changbaishan) volcano](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-01162-0) (Version 8.2.0 of FALL3D - no GPU acc) 
    - The simulation should be "reproducible" (TBD) as they provide Datasets, configuration input files and scripts used for the simulations described in the paper - see https://zenodo.org/records/10159966

## Suitability as Workflow
